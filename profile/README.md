## Hey, Untrustnova in hereðŸ‘‹!

<img src="./../icon.webp" width="70" align="right">

A small independent community of developers, designers, and engineers come together to build meaningful digital products.  

ðŸ’¡ *Started as a side project. Evolved into something more.*  
What began as a collective of curious developers has grown into a creative technology company focused on building reliable, human-centered software.  
We work at the intersection of design, engineering, and curiosity - turning small ideas into tools that empower people and communities.  


We donâ€™t chase perfection or trends. We chase learning â€” the kind that happens when you break something, fix it, and accidentally make it better. Every project here is a reflection of what we love: simple tools, weird experiments, and the thrill of making something work.
