## Hey, Untrustnova in here 👋!

<img src="./../icon.webp" width="95" align="right">

**A small independent collective of developers, designers, and engineers** building human-centered digital products.  
What began as a side project has grown into a creative technology studio focused on **reliable software**, thoughtful design, and a healthy dose of curiosity.

We work at the intersection of **design × engineering × curiosity** — turning small ideas into tools that empower people and communities.

### How we build (still playful, more intentional)
- **Learn by doing**: break it → fix it → make it better.
- **Ship small, iterate fast**: value momentum over perfection.
- **Simple > clever**: clarity, maintainability, and boring-but-reliable choices.
- **Human first**: accessible, inclusive, and genuinely useful.
- **Craft with pragmatism**: tasteful details, measurable outcomes.

> We don’t chase perfection or trends.  
> We chase learning — the kind that happens when you ship, listen, and improve.  
> Every project reflects what we love: **simple tools**, **weird experiments**, and the thrill of making something work.

### What we do
- **Products** — small tools that solve real problems with delightful UX.  
- **Experiments (Playground)** — odd ideas, prototypes, and “what ifs” that sometimes become real things.  
- **Collaborations** — we team up when our curiosity (and timelines) align.

---

### Our stack (what we actually use & enjoy)
- **Backend**: PHP (Laravel), Node.js (Express), **Go (Golang)**  
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite  
- **Data**: MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, Supabase  
- **DevOps**: Docker, Git, CI/CD, observability, pragmatic security

*(Tools may vary per project — we pick what fits, not what’s fashionable.)*

### Mantra & Motto
**Polished tagline**: *Where unlikely ideas earn trust — and sometimes explode into masterpieces.*  
**Original motto** (we keep it close to heart):  
> **"Where Ideas What We Didn't Trust To Success, And Then Suddenly Explode Into Masterpieces."**
